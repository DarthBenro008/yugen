## The Problem

Human psychology is an intriguing subject. Many people in the world go into depression or feel sad which affects their lifestyle and work. Sometimes these small things add up and impact one's life in the longer term.  
In the ruthlessly competitive world of the 21st Century, productivity highly contributes to the personal growth and mental health of a person that guarantees survival.  
Many people in this world are unable to tap the power of their productivity and that is a major issue.

## The Solution

YuGen is a productivity and self-growth tool. The motive of the app is:

> The app won’t dynamically tell you what to do, but it’s is a reflection of your day and gives you control over what to do further.

YuGen is a tool that enables one to tap their hidden productivity potential and make them feel good about themselves.
